# IT-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-FINAL-ASSOCIATE-TRACKER


# This project is the project I completed for my IT485 capstone class to complete my degree. The assignment was to create a web application with a front and back end, utilize two different programming languages, and deliver a graph based on arguments giving by the user.


# The goal of this project was to access the user's AWS console and grab AWS Cloudtrail's Event History json data and return a graph with the frequency of their occurrences. In doing this, the user (we intended to be a Cloud Team Manager) would be able to see the activity of their associates and gain insight on their performances.
